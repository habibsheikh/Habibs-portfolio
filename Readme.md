1. Analysis on ‘Profitable Application Profiles’ on Apple ‘App Store' and
Android 'Play Store’ -

• Goal of this project was to use basic Python coding to compute
informational data out of the already available data on AppStore
and Play Store, which will be used to find out profitable app profiles
on both application stores
• Apps which were analysed were free to install. The main source of
revenue for free apps are in-app ads. This means that the revenue
for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that
use the app
• My goal for this project was to analyse data to help developers
understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users

2. Exploring 'Hacker News’ posts -

• Aim of this project was to examine a dataset on the posts that have
been made on the famous technology blog 'Hacker news’
• The dataset includes important information like title of the post,
respective url, points (upvotes- downvotes), username of person
who posted it and date of post
• Concluded this project with important information about best time
for posting on the blog to gain maximum attraction of users

3. Analysis of German eBay 'Car Sales Data’ -

• Analysed a huge dataset of car sales made on German eBay
• My aim was to make this process easy and efficient using Python's
NumPy and Pandas libraries

4. Exploratory Data Visualisation –
• A quick and basic project demonstrating my Data Visualisation
skills

5. Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94 Interstate Highway - 
• In this project I have analysed the traffic conditions of USA's I-94 Interstate Highway. My findings were visualised in the form of relational Scatter plots, Bar plots/Histograms and Line graphs.
